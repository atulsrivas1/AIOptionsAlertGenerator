# Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a professional-grade, AI-powered options trading signal generator. The system will analyze a wide array of market and alternative data to identify, validate, and generate high-probability trading signals.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Data Ingestion

- The system must ingest data from multiple sources.
- **2.1.1. Data Provider Requirements:**
    - For the **Research Phase**:
        - **Alpha Vantage:** To be used for fetching historical daily OHLCV data for the underlying asset.
        - **Polygon.io:** To be used for fetching historical options chain data, including open interest, Greeks, and implied volatility.
    - For the **Production Phase**:
        - **Alpaca:** To be used for its real-time streaming API for the underlying asset.
        - **Polygon.io:** To be used for its real-time options data feed.
- **2.1.2. Data Types:**
    - **Standard Market Data:** Real-time and historical OHLCV data for equities.
    - **Options Market Data:** Real-time and historical options chain data, including Greeks, implied volatility surfaces, and open interest.
    - **Alternative Data:** News sentiment, social media sentiment, SEC filings, and macroeconomic data (e.g., VIX term structure, yield curve).

### 2.2. Feature Engineering

The system must be capable of generating a diverse and sophisticated set of features.

- **2.2.1. Multi-Timeframe Features:**
    - The system must be able to resample data into multiple timeframes (e.g., 1m, 5m, 1h, 1d).
    - It must calculate technical indicators on each of these timeframes to capture the overall market context (trend alignment, fractal analysis).

- **2.2.2. Options-Specific Features:**
    - **Greeks Dynamics:** Features derived from the rate of change of option Greeks (e.g., Delta, Gamma) to model market maker positioning.
    - **Volatility Surface:** Features describing the term structure and skew of implied volatility.
    - **Flow Analysis:** Indicators for unusual options activity (UOA) and dark pool prints.
    - **Microstructure:** Features derived from bid-ask spreads and order flow imbalances.

- **2.2.3. Alternative Data Features:**
    - **Sentiment Scores:** Process and score sentiment from news and social media sources.
    - **Macro Indicators:** Features based on macroeconomic data like the VIX and yield curve.

### 2.3. AI Model & Training

- **2.3.1. Sophisticated Labeling:**
    - The system must implement the **Triple Barrier Method** for labeling training data. This includes defining a profit target, a stop-loss, and a time horizon for each trade, resulting in three possible outcomes: win, loss, or timeout.

- **2.3.2. Advanced Training Techniques:**
    - The system should support **Multi-Task Learning**, allowing the model to simultaneously predict direction, magnitude, and volatility.
    - The architecture should allow for future experimentation with **Meta-Learning**, **Adversarial Training**, and **Curriculum Learning**.

### 2.4. Signal Generation

- A signal is generated based on the output of the AI model and must pass through a risk management filter.
- The signal must include:
    - Ticker, specific option contract, and entry price range.
    - Confidence score from the model.
    - The predicted outcome (win/loss/timeout) from the Triple Barrier Method.
    - An explanation of the key features driving the signal (XAI).

### 2.5. Backtesting & Validation

- **2.5.1. Rigorous Validation Framework:**
    - The backtesting engine must implement **Walk-Forward Validation** as its primary methodology.
    - It must include **Purged and Embargoed Cross-Validation** to prevent data leakage and lookahead bias.

- **2.5.2. Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics:**
    - The system must calculate and log a holistic set of metrics for every experiment, categorized as:
        - **Financial Metrics:** Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Calmar Ratio, Max Drawdown.
        - **Prediction Metrics:** Profit Factor, Hit Rate, Precision@K.
        - **Risk Metrics:** Value-at-Risk (VaR) Coverage, performance under stress tests.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **3.1. MLOps & Reproducibility:**
    - Every experiment must be tracked in a system like **MLflow**, logging code versions, parameters, models, and metrics.
    - The system must use a **Feature Store** (like Feast) to ensure consistency between training and inference.

- **3.2. Scalability & Performance:**
    - The system must support distributed computing (**Dask/Ray**) for large-scale backtesting and feature engineering.
    - Data ingestion must be handled by a high-throughput streaming platform (**Apache Kafka**).
    - Model inference must be performed by a dedicated, low-latency serving solution (**Seldon, TF Serving**).

- **3.3. Orchestration & Automation:**
    - Data pipelines must be scheduled and managed by a workflow orchestrator (**Apache Airflow**).
    - ML training pipelines must be orchestrated by a dedicated ML platform (**Kubeflow**).

- **3.4. Security:**
    - All sensitive data (API keys, credentials) must be stored in a secure vault.

- **3.5. Usability:**
    - The system must provide a clear interface for visualizing experiment results, backtests, and live signal performance.
